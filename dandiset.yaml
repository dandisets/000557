description: "This dataset contains recordings from PtNRGrids, which are devices designed
  to record electrocorticography (ECoG) activities from the brain surface at high-spatial
  resolution. PtNRGrids used here were a square-shaped array with 1024 channels and
  a 150-Âµm pitch, which was implanted to record neural activity from the entire right
  primary somatosensory barrel cortex. The sensory response on the brain was evoked
  by delivering air puffs through a microcapillary tube to individually stimulate
  individual whiskers on the contralateral side. This dataset demonstrates the high-spatial
  resolution recording capability of PtNRGrids isolate functional cortical columns
  in sub-mm resolution from the surface of the brain.\n\n[Publication corresponding
